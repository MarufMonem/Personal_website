                    <p>Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the market, which uses blockchain technology to bring in
                        features like decentralization, anonymity, and trust. However, it still struggles with broader
                        adaptation due to long verification times and high transaction fees. As a result, it is lagging
                        behind competitors. We need to provide faster confirmations to tackle these issues while
                        ensuring
                        stable earnings for the miners. However, it is challenging to increase the block sizes or
                        decrease
                        the average block creation time without affecting the stability and security of the network. To
                        address this conundrum, firstly, an optimization problem is formulated where the objective is to
                        increase the transaction count in every cycle. Based on that, a comprehensive learning framework
                        is
                        developed to solve the formulated problem since the issue is intractable and hard to solve in
                        polynomial time. The proposed learning framework includes (i) implementing a viable data-driven
                        infrastructure with a machine learning (ML) root, (ii) training learning models with efficient
                        generalization capability, and (iii) predicting the ideal block size in every block generation
                        cycle. Our concept uses extreme gradient boost (XGB) as its core algorithm, which analyzes nine
                        attributes associated with the Bitcoin network. These network-allied data points assist the
                        model in
                        creating an adaptive block size in the blockchain. XGB, trained using the last four years of
                        real-world data, can predict block sizes with a 63.41% accuracy. The model ensures an all-around
                        positive change in Bitcoin with a 12.29% increase in block size, a 13.45% increase in
                        transaction
                        fee (USD), and a 14.88% increase in transaction approval rate and transaction count, thus
                        addressing

                    <p>Cryptocurrencies are the new form of trade that has revolutionized how we look into our
                        financial
                        institutions. Bitcoin dominates the industry with the highest market share among the hundreds of
                        other cryptocurrencies. However, high energy consumption leading to increasing carbon emission,
                        prioritizing high-value transactions, and long waiting times are some of the flaws preventing it
                        from reaching its full potential. Owing to the block rewards getting halved every four years,
                        miners
                        and researchers are fearful that this would be the breaking point of Bitcoin’s success. This
                        article
                        proposes an Industry-4.0-compliant next-generation Bitcoin architecture by introducing a dynamic
                        and
                        sustainable block concept. Along with our modified knapsack algorithms, i.e., priority-based 0/1
                        knapsack and advanced-priority-based 0/1 knapsack, we can ensure a balanced transaction
                        selection,
                        quicker verification, higher transaction throughput, reduced carbon emission, and increased
                        earnings
                        for the miners. Moreover, with the addition of only one of our proposed sustainable blocks, we
                        can
                        cut down verification times by 50% and increase throughput by 39%. We can also reduce carbon
                        emissions per transaction by 61.3%, which would help reduce Bitcoins’ large carbon footprint,
                        enabling us to approach greener digital transactions.</p>

                    <p>The use of Blockchain in cryptocurrency introduces a technology that acts as an
                        unswervingly growing
                        ledger with the capability to keep an everlasting record of all the transactions in a secure,
                        chronological and immutable system. It removes dependency on central financial services,
                        essentially
                        removing the middle-man from the transaction. Bitcoin holds the highest share in the
                        cryptocurrency
                        market. However, Bitcoin has three major problems which are excessive power consumption,
                        confirmation time, and fair reward distribution. Hence, we propose a system (FaircoinBD) where
                        we
                        focus on reducing energy consumption by limiting participation, increasing propagation speed and
                        fair reward distribution. We have also compared our proposed system with Bitcoin and Ether in
                        terms
                        of energy consumption and have reached the conclusion, that if Bitcoin and Ethereum network used
                        our
                        proposed model there would be a 83.33% and 80.0012% reduction of energy consumption
                        respectively.</p>

                        unparalleled in
                        his ability to find extremely interesting bugs in our products. He understood the product
                        extremely well and knew how it would be used by our customers. He was the most prolific bug
                        submitter on the team and was only happy if he was finding bugs. As part of the QA team, it
                        is sometimes difficult to have a good relationship with the developers – they don’t like to
                        hear that you’ve found even more bugs in their code. Maruf was extremely successful in
                        developing those good relationships and working closely with developers. This extended
                        beyond just our local team, but to the extended onshore team in other parts of the world as
                        well. Part of the reason for Maruf's success, which in no way lessens his technical ability,
                        is his attitude. He always looks on the bright side of things and puts a smile on your face
                        – even when he’s telling you about the newest “bug” he’s found. His care for the product and
                        for his teammates is clear. He’s the only one I know who can break the product and build a
                        relationship at the same time</p>
